FAQ:
--------------------------

Q: Your filter doesn't filter white/blue items!

A: It does. However, don't test it in low level areas. In low level areas it shows pretty much everything (it becomes stricter as you level)


Q: My items disappear after a few seconds?!

A: Hit the "Z" button. You're welcome.
